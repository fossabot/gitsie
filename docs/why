#Why Gitsie?

### Flexible
From a developer's point of view, gitsie gives you much needed flexiblity. There are 4 different sripts that trigger on 4 important events: when your repo is being downloaded by the user, before and after the user has installed the repo, and before the user deletes your repo. Customize the 4 scripts to your preference an you have 100% control over your user's experience.

###Fat-Free
unlike many of the popular package managers, gitsie doesn't come with all the bloat. the entire project size is about 4 MB, and that includes all the third party libraries, and other redundant stuff.

###Easy to maintain
As mentioned earlier, all you have to do to customize the user's experience is to edit the 4 control scripts. You may have an interactive build system with issue-resolving; you can implement a system-setup using the post-install script. The choice is yours.
